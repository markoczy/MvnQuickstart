# MvnQuickstart

MvnQuickstart is an easy out-of-the-box Template to create a simple Maven Project. It supports the dependencies plugin (libraries default to `project/lib`) 
and the resources plugin (resources default to `project/lib`). The project can be used as a template for creating other projects. When working with spring boot, 
you should rather use the Spring initializr as this is a purely maven based solution. 

If not using VS Code, just delete the `.vscode` folder.

The project is unlicensed and purely public domain.
